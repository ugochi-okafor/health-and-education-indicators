ID,Stakeholder Category,Question/Theme,Key Insight/Feedback,Implication for NLP and AI Research
1,Healthcare Professional,Building Trust with AI Tools,Engage community gatekeepers to educate them on AI benefits and how it addresses healthcare gaps.,NLP can develop culturally tailored educational tools to communicate AI benefits to local stakeholders.
2,Healthcare Professional,Community Perception of AI,Rural communities distrust AI due to low awareness and a preference for physical interaction with healthcare workers.,Use NLP to create sentiment analysis models that assess trust levels and concerns in community feedback.
3,Healthcare Professional,Transparency and Understanding,Use continuous education and colour-coded visual outputs to enhance AI transparency for rural patients.,NLP models should prioritise interpretability and simplicity in communicating results to improve user comprehension.
4,Community Member,Cultural Influence on AI Acceptance,"Leverage spiritual beliefs and traditional values to position AI as an ally, not a disruptor.",NLP can adapt healthcare communication to integrate spiritual and cultural references.
5,Healthcare Professional,Ethical Concerns and Privacy,Patients are more comfortable when data privacy is explained by attending staff.,Develop NLP-driven consent forms and privacy explanations in local languages to build trust.
6,Healthcare Professional,Language Barriers,"AI translation of medical information into local languages (e.g., Hausa, Yoruba) improves trust and understanding.",Deploy NLP-powered translation models for rural healthcare communication.
7,Healthcare Professional,Culturally Appropriate AI Communication,Pilot AI tools with community gatekeepers and allow feedback for continuous improvement.,NLP systems should use participatory design and feedback loops to ensure cultural appropriateness.
8,Policymaker,Regulatory Compliance,Incorporate regulatory policies of professional bodies to ensure patient safety and ethical AI use.,Create NLP tools to automate compliance checks against regulatory guidelines.
9,Policymaker,Data Protection,Train staff on data privacy and limit data access for ethical AI use in rural settings.,"Use NLP for secure data handling, including anonymisation and restricted access mechanisms."
10,Policymaker,Fairness in AI Resource Distribution,Conduct need-based analyses to ensure fair distribution of healthcare resources across rural areas.,NLP models can analyse healthcare data to prioritise equitable resource distribution.
11,Healthcare Professional,Successes with AI Integration,"Telemedicine has helped where physical infrastructure is lacking, though referral systems are still needed.",NLP systems can enhance telemedicine by supporting triage through language models.
12,Community Member,Balancing AI and Human Oversight,Human oversight ensures AI errors do not compromise patient safety.,NLP tools should include explainability features for healthcare providers to cross-check AI decisions.
13,Community Member,Language and User Feedback,"Request for local language voice notes and easier-to-understand medical terms (e.g., avoiding intimidating terms).",NLP should focus on localised voice and text interfaces to simplify communication in rural settings.
14,Focus Group Participant,Awareness and Chatbot Feedback,"Chatbots were helpful but need simpler instructions and options for multiple languages (Yoruba, Hausa).",NLP-driven chatbots should prioritise user-friendly multilingual interfaces to expand accessibility.
15,Focus Group Participant,AI and Cultural Beliefs,Older women preferred culturally sensitive healthcare instructions and appreciated options for long-term planning tools.,NLP systems should adapt healthcare messages to align with local customs and taboos.
